                Medium to heavy, well-drained soils favor wheat crops. Heavy and deep soil should be selected for irrigated wheat. Good yield of wheat can be obtained if chemical fertilizers are mixed with rich soil in medium type of soil. While sowing wheat, it should be planted in heavy soil so that rain water moisture is retained for maximum time and helps in getting more yield.

                Trimbak, Tapovan, Sarbati variety MCS 6122 and Bakshi variety Godavari should be selected for sowing at the time of horticulture. NIAW 34, AKW 4627 varieties are useful for horticultural late sowing and Panchvati, Sharad varieties for arable sowing. If the availability of water is less, Netravati variety should be planted.

                Sowing should preferably be done in south-east direction. Timely sowing of horticultural crop in two rows 20 cm. and late sowing 18 cm. Keep a distance. Wheat sowing is shallow i.e. 5-6 cm. To be done on the room. So the germination is good. Arable wheat is sown in two rows 20 cm apart. Keep a distance. To cover the seed, the harrow should be run upside down so that the seed is well buried in the soil and covered with soil. Keeping in mind the slope of the land, the size of 2.5 to 4 meters wide and 7 to 25 meters long should be laid for wheat.

                48 kg of nitrogen, 24 kg of phosphorus and 16 kg of palash should be given per acre for timely sowing of irrigated wheat. At the time of sowing, half the amount of nitrogen and full amount of phosphorus and palash should be given. The remaining half of the nitrogen should be applied three weeks after sowing, after weeding at the crown budding stage. 32 kg of nitrogen, 16 kg of phosphorus and 16 kg of palash should be applied per acre for late sowing of irrigated wheat. <br>
                At the time of sowing, half the amount of nitrogen and full amount of phosphorus and palash should be given. The remaining half of the nitrogen should be applied three weeks after sowing. For arable wheat, 16 kg of nitrogen and 8 kg of phosphorus should be sown per acre. Apart from this, spraying of 2 percent urea solution should be done at grain filling stage i.e. after 65-70 days.
