                he soil should be deeply plowed twice vertically and horizontally. Break the clods and loosen the soil
                by giving 1-2 layers of kulwa as per requirement. Before planting sugarcane, the green crop should be
                buried in the ground with jute/Dhaincha. 8, 10 and 12 tonnes of cow dung, 3 tonnes of composted manure,
                2.5 tonnes of pressed compost and 2 tonnes of vermicompost per acre for early, pre-season and
                late-season sugarcane respectively if no green crop is planted, half and the remaining half during the

            <div class="custom-col">
                Sugarcane should be cultivated using seedling, one-eye or two-eye tipri. 9-11 months old, healthy, juicy
                and pure, fresh, improved varieties of chickpeas grown in chickpea plantations should be used.<br>

                <b>One eye - </b>distance between two eyes should be 30 cm. Planting should preferably be done dry. Keep
                the eye separate from the upper side and give water lightly or before planting the sugarcane, leave a
                little water in the rain and apply koli on the steam.<br>
                <b>Two Eyes – </b>Keep a distance of 15-20 cm between the two tips and make sure that both the eyes come
                to the side. For this, even wet infected banana will work. But care should be taken that the tipri is
                not pressed deeply. 10000 per acre for heavy land and 12000 for medium land.

                <br> <b>Seedlings – </b>Seedlings prepared using cocopeat in plastic trays are ready for
                planting in 30-45 days.

            Weed management should be done by weeding as required. After 2 months after planting with the help of tools, weeding should be done by weeding. After sugarcane planting, spray 2 kg of Atrataf or 500 g of metribuzin mixed with 400 liters of water per acre when the land is still wet. If infestation of weeds like lavala or grass is found after sugarcane emergence, spray glyphosate 1 kg per acre mixed with 400 liters of water only on the weeds. For this, WFN40 nozzle should be used and plastic hood should be used on the nozzle.

              Generally water beds should be 8 cm deep till large constructions. After that 10 cm depth should be given. Depending on the season, watering should be given after 8-10 days in summer, 14-15 days in monsoon and 18-20 days in winter. Using more water than this leads to salinization of the soil and also drains nutrients through runoff. Drip irrigation system should be used to save water and increase sugarcane production

            Sugarcane should be cut according to season and maturity. Crop water should be stopped for 15 days before cutting. The cut sugarcane should be immediately sent for cutting. Sugarcane should be cut in the first 12-13 months, in the pre-season 14-15 months and in the off-season 16-18 months.
