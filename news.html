                <p>Reconciliation Scheme - There are often disputes between farmers regarding land possession and wahi-wati, now to settle these disputes, the Maharashtra Government has introduced the Reconciliation Scheme. The scheme will provide concession in registration fee and stamp duty for exchange deed of agricultural land holders if the possession of agricultural land in the name of one farmer is with another and if the possession of agricultural land in the name of the other farmer is with the first farmer. Stamp duty will be Rs.1000 and registration fee will be Rs.100 for exchange of deed registration. The scheme will create positivity among the farmers and the cases in various courts will be settled and there will be no unnecessary interference of land surveyors.

                <h2>Pik Vima 2023 : Does crop insurance cover in case of rain failure? How is it given?</h2>
                <p>The Maharashtra government has implemented a crop insurance scheme of Rs 1 in the state from this year. 1 crore 69 lakh farmers of the state have participated in this scheme.
                    On the other hand, there is heavy rainfall in most parts of the state. Due to lack of rain, soybean crop failed. Cotton leaves are falling. Farmers are saying that the production will decrease due to this.
                    In such a situation, questions are being raised as to whether the farmers who have participated in the crop insurance scheme will get insurance compensation and if so, how much they will get. </p>
